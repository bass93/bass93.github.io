        <p>The Agent-Based Model was developed using Python. <br>Through utilising basic Pyhton language and analysis techniques, it was possible to design 'agents' (in this case sheep) who could randomly move in a fxed 300mx300m environment (terrain grid). In addition to key functions such as moving and communicating with each other, the agents were also able to change the environment by eating and vomiting the simulated area.<br><hr/>
