    <p>The Agent-Based Model was developed using Python. <br>Through utilising basic Pyhton language and analysis techniques, it was possible to design 'agents' (in this case sheep) who could randomly move in a fixed 300mx300m environment (terrain grid). In addition to key functions such as moving and communicating with each other, the agents were also able to change their environment, through the creation of eating and vomiting functions.<br><br>You can see how the model was developed below, or visit the code page to run it yourself <a href="The%20code.html" style="color: floralwhite">here</a></p><br><hr/>
