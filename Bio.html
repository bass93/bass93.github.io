    <hr/>

        <p>I am currently undertaking an Integrated MSc and PhD programme in the ESRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Analytics and Society.
            <br>The official title of my project is: ‘Modelling the impact of predicted and actual weather on customer behaviour’. The PhD project partner is a major UK online retailer that offers an array of products through two main digital department stores. 
            <br><br><br><br><hr/>
            The Project will fundamentally aim to investigate and explore patterns of online spend between product categories, in regards to changing weather conditions. While there has been some study dedicated towards the relationship between certain product categories and weather conditions in a physical retail store context, there is much less evidence and research focused towards online consumption. Therefore, through working with the PhD partner, the project will begin to address and explore this unknown relationship, further striving towards understanding what this may mean for purchasing patterns, product susceptibility and seasonality.  
            <br><br><br><br><hr/>As part of the first year MSc, there are a number of taught modules, including ‘Programming for Social Science’ , (undertaken at the University of Leeds) for which this website and subsequent Agent-Based model was created. 
            <br>If you’re interested, below you can find out more about me and my path to where I am today!
