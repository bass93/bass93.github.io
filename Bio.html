<h1> My Bio</h1>
<hr/>

<p>I am currently undertaking an Integrated MSc and PhD programme in the ESRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Analytics and Society.
<br>The official title of my project is: ‘Modelling the impact of predicted and actual weather on customer behaviour’. The PhD project partner is the Shop Direct Group, who dominate the UK online retail market through key brands such as: Very.co.uk and Littlewoods.co.uk. 
<br>As part of the first year MSc, there are a number of taught modules, including ‘Programming for Social Science’ , (undertaken at the University of Leeds) for which this website and subsequent Agent-Based model was created.
